DevStack is used by developers to install OpenStack and is not intended
for production use.  To get details on using DevStack, refer to other
documentation links such as:

* For general DevStack information, refer to
  `DevStack <https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/>`_
* For general ML2 DevStack details, refer to
  `ML2_DevStack <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2#Using_ML2_in_Devstack/>`_

As discussed in these links, ``local.conf`` is DevStack's configuration file
for defining OpenStack installations.  To include installing the
networking-cisco repository, add the following configuration.

.. code-block:: ini

    [[local|localrc]]
    enable_plugin networking-cisco https://github.com/openstack/networking-cisco

.. end

For further Cisco feature configuration details using DevStack, look for other
plugin/driver subsections in the Cisco contributor guide for sample DevStack
configurations.
