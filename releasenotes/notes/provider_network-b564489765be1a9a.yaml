    Nexus: Provider Network Limited Operations

    The Openstack/network administrator may want to control how the Openstack
    create/update/delete port events program the Nexus switch for provider
    networks. Two configuration variables have been introduced to address
    limiting the actions taken for provider networks during port events.
    The variables are defined under the [ml2_cisco] section header::

       [ml2_cisco]
       # Provider VLANs are automatically created as needed on the Nexus switch.
       provider_vlan_auto_create=[True|False]

       # Provider VLANs are automatically trunked as needed on the ports of the
       # Nexus switch.
       provider_vlan_auto_trunk=[True|False]
