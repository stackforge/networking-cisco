    Nexus: Provider Network Limited Operations

    The Openstack/network administrator may want to control how the Openstack
    port events program the Nexus switch for provider networks. Two configuration
    variables have been introduced to suppress vlan creation and the vlan trunk
    port setting on the Nexus switch for provider networks. These variables,
    'provider_vlan_auto_create' and 'provider_vlan_auto_trunk', are defined under
    the [ml2_cisco] section header.
