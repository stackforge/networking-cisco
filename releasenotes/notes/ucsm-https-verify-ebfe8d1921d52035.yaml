    Cisco UCSM: Add config to control SSL certificate checks

    This feature allows a cloud admin to disable SSL certificate
    checking when the UCSM driver connects to the UCS Managers
    provided in its configuration. SSL certificate checking is
    ON by default and setting the ``ucsm_https_verify``
    configuration parameter to ``False`` turns it OFF. Turning it
    OFF makes the connection insecure and vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.
