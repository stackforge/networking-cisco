    Nexus: Time to secure https certificates

    In release 5.4.0, the ability to verify https certificates was implemented.
    The default was originally set to False for insecure https connections
    to allow time to acquire certificates.  In this release, the default
    is changed to True so certificates will be verified for secured
    connections.

    See release notes for release 5.4.0 for details on this feature and
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1778275
    for implementation details.
