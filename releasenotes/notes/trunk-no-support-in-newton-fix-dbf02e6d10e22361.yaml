    Nexus: Neutron trunking feature not supported in Newton

    Introduced a fix to prevent an error from being generated
    when using openstack newton or below branches with
    baremetal configurations.  The error message seen
    is "TypeError: get_object() got an unexpected keyword"
    "argument 'port_id'".  For implementation details,
    refer to https://review.openstack.org/#/c/542877.
