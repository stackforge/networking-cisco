    Nexus: RESTAPI Client Scaling Improvement

    To improve performance, the same cookie will be used in requests until
    it expires and the Nexus device returns a status_code of 403.  When
    this is detected, an attempt to refresh the cookie occurs and upon
    successful receipt of a new cookie the request that originally failed
    will be resent.

    Nexus: https certification now supported by RESTAPI Client

    The Nexus RESTAPI Client now sends requests using https instead of http
    which results in communication with the Nexus to be encrypted.
    Certificate verification can also be performed.  A new configuration
    option 'https_verify' controls this latter capability.  When set to
    False, the communication path is insecure making it vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.  Initially, the default for 'https_verify'
    is set to False but will change to True in the 'Cisco 6.0.0' release.
    If a certificate is already available and configured on the Nexus device,
    it is highly recommended to set this options to True in the
    neutron start-up configuration file.

    For testing or lab purposes, a temporary local certificate
    can be generated and the certificate filename can be provided
    in the configuration option 'https_local_certificate'. This depends
    on the Nexus device being configured with the local key and certificate
    file.

    Both configuration options are available for every Nexus switch
    configured.  Refer to the
    :doc:`Nexus Configuration Reference </configuration/ml2-nexus>`
    for more details on these options as well as
