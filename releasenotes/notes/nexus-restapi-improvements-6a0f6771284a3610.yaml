    Nexus: RESTAPI Client Scaling Improvement

    To improve performance, the same cookie will be used in requests until
    it expires and the Nexus device returns a status_code of 403.  When
    this is detected, an attempt to refresh the cookie occurs and upon
    successful receipt of a new cookie the request that originally failed
    will be resent.

    Nexus: https certification now supported by RESTAPI Client

    The Nexus RESTAPI Client now sends requests using https instead
    of http which results in communication with the Nexus to be
    encrypted.  Certificate verification is also performed.
    If a certificate is not available, the configuration
    option 'https_verify' can be set to False in the neutron
    start-up configuration file for an insecure connection.
    For testing or lab purposes, a temporary local certificate
    can be generated and the certificate filename can be provided
    in the configuration option 'https_local_certificate'.

    Both configuration options are available for each switch.
    Refer to the Configuration Section for more details on
    these options as well as
