    Nexus: Remove deprecated format of host interface mapping config

    The host to interface mapping configuration was deprecated and
    replaced in release 6.1.0 (see previous release notes).  The
    deprecated configuration is now removed so the replacement
    configuration must take its place.  The following demonstrates
    the old versus new configuration.

    ``Old:`` `hostname_abc=ethernet:1/19,1/20`

    ``New:`` `host_ports_mapping=hostname_abc:[ethernet:1/19,1/20]`

    Refer to https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1771672
    for implementation details.
