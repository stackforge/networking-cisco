    Nexus: Remove deprecated host interface mapping configuration

    The host to interface mapping configuration was deprecated and
    replaced in release 6.1.0 (see previous release notes).  The
    deprecated configuration is now removed so the replacement
    configuration should take its place.  The following demonstrates
    the old versus new configuration.

    ``Old:`` `hostname_abc=ethernet:1/19,1/20`,
    ``New:`` `host_ports_mapping=hostname_abc:[ethernet:1/19,1/20]`
