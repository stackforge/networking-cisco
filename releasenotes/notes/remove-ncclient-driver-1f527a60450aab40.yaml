    Nexus: Remove Nexus ncclient configuration driver

    The ``ncclient`` Driver used to configure Nexus was deprecated
    in the ``Cisco 5.5.0`` release.  It is replaced by the current
    default RESTAPI Driver. The ncclient driver is now removed along
    with related configuration options which include
    ``persistent_switch_config``, ``never_cache_ssh_connection``,
    ``host_key_checks``, and ``nexus_driver``.  For the RESTAPI
    driver to work, the :command:'feature nxapi' must be
    preconfigured on the Nexus device and the correct version of
    NX-OS must be installed.  Refer to
    :doc:`Nexus Installation Guide </install/ml2-nexus>`.
    for more prerequisite details.
