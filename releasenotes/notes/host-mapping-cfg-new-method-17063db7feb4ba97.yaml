    Nexus: Host Mapping Configuration being replaced

    The host mapping configuration beneath the header `ml2_mech_cisco_nexus`
    currently does not have a static config option name.  This can lead to
    some issues where even typographical errors can be interpreted as a host
    mapping config.  The config option `host_ports_mapping` has been introduced
    to resolve this shortcoming.  The following demonstrates the before and
    after config change.

    ``Before:`` `hostname_abc=ethernet:1/19`,
    ``After:`` `host_ports_mapping=hostname_abc:[ethernet:1/19]`
