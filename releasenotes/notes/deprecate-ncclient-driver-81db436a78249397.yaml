    Nexus: The ncclient/ssh config driver has been deprecated for removal

    Use of ncclient/ssh_driver will be removed in the 'Cisco 7.0.0'
    release.  It will be replaced by the RESTAPI Driver.  Some
    configuration options are also deprecated for removal
    since they relate only to the ncclient driver.  These include
    'persistent_switch_config', 'never_cache_ssh_connection',
    'host_key_checks', and 'nexus_driver'. For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1705036

    Nexus: Set RESTAPI driver as default replacing ncclient driver

    The Nexus 9K handles the RESTAPI events more efficiently and without
    session limitations.  It is now the default and will be the only
    choice in 'Cisco 7.0.0' release.  This may require the administrator
    to upgrade the Nexus operating system.  If necessary, use
    'nexus_driver=ncclient' to temporarily go back to original default
    driver; however, some enhancements may not be available when using
    this driver. For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1705036
