    Nexus: Permanently remove the ncclient/ssh driver

    Use of ncclient/ssh_driver will be eliminated in the 'Cisco 7.0.0'
    release.  Instead, it will be permanently replaced by the
    RESTAPI Driver.  Some configuration options will also be eliminated
    since they related only to this driver.  These include
    'persistent_switch_config', 'never_cache_ssh_connection',
    'host_key_checks', and 'nexus_driver'. For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1705036

    Nexus: Set RESTAPI driver as default replacing ncclient driver

    The Nexus 9K handles the RESTAPI events more efficiently and without
    session limitations.  It is now the default starting in this release
    and will be the only choice in 'Cisco 7.0.0' release.  This may require
    upgrade of Nexus operating system.  If necessary, use
    'nexus_driver=ncclient' to temporarily go back to original default
    driver; however, enhancements may not be available in this driver
    starting with this release.  For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1705036
