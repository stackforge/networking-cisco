    Cisco UCSM: Auto detection of Compute hosts

    This feature allows a cloud admin to expand the size of the Openstack
    cloud dynamically by adding more compute hosts to an existing UCS
    Manager. The cloud admin can now add the hostname of this new compute
    host to the "Name" field of its Service Profile on the UCSM. Then when
    a VM is scheduled on this compute host, the Cisco UCSM ML2 mechanism
    driver goes through all the Service Profiles of all the UCSMs known to
    it to figure out the UCSM and the Service Profile associated with that
    host. After learning the UCSM and Service Profile, the mechanism driver
    saves this information for future operations. Note that this method
    cannot be used to add more Controller nodes to the cloud.
