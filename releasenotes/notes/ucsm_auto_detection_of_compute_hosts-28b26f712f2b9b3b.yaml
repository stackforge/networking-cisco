    Cisco UCSM: Auto detection of Compute hosts

    This feature allows a Cloud Admin to expand the size of the Openstack
    cloud dynamically by adding more compute hosts to an existing UCS
    Manager. The Cloud Admin would have to add the hostname of this new
    compute host to the "Name" field of its Service Profile on the UCSM.
    When a VM is scheduled on this compute host, the Cisco UCSM ML2 mechanism
    driver, goes through all the Service Profiles of all the UCSMs known to
    it, to figure out which UCSM this compute host is connected to and which
    Service Profile is associated with this host. The learning process takes
    some time, but after this 1st operation, the mechanism driver would have
    permanantly learnt the host's UCSM and Service Profile association. Note
    that this method cannot be used to add more Controller nodes to the cloud.
