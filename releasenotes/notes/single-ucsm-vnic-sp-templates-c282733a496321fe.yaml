    Cisco UCSM: vNIC and Service Profile Template support for Single UCSM

    This feature allows a cloud admin to take advantage of the Service
    Profile Template and vNIC Template configuration options available
    on the UCS Manager. The UCSM driver can be provided with the Service
    Profile or the Service Profile Template configuration, and it will
    handle the configuration of the UCS Servers accordingly. The vNIC
    Templates can be used to configure several vNIC on different UCS
    Servers, all connected to the same physical network. The driver
    will handle configuration of the appropriate vNIC Template with
    the VLAN configuration associated with the corresponding neutron
    provider network.
