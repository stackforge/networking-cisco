    Nexus: Remove deprecated intfcfg.portchannel configuration

    The intfcfg.portchannel configuration was deprecated and
    replaced in release 5.4.0 (see previous release notes).  The
    deprecated configuration is now removed so the replacement
    configuration intfcfg_portchannel should take its place.
