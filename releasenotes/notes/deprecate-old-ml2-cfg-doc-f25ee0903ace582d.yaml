    Nexus/UCSM: Deprecate old ML2 documentation file

    In older versions of networking-cisco, the file
    ``etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_cisco.ini`` contains all ML2
    configuration documentation for Nexus and UCSM.  This has been
    replaced with a much improved set of documentation which can be
    found at http://networking-cisco.readthedocs.io.
    For details of changes, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1780445
