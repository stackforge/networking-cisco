    Nexus: Improved port-channel support with baremetal events

    When there are multiple ethernet interfaces in the baremetal's
    neutron port event, the Nexus driver determines whether the
    interfaces are already configured as members of a port-channel.
    If not, it creates a new port-channel interface and adds the
    ethernet interfaces as members. In either case, trunk vlans are
    applied to the port-channel.  For this to be successful,
    a new configuration variable 'vpc_pool' must be defined with
    a pool of vpc ids for each switch.  This must be defined beneath
    the section header [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<switch-ip-address>].
    A vpc id common between participating switches will be selected.
    To get more details on defining this variable, refer to
    networking-cisco repo, file:
    etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_cisco.ini

    Nexus: User customizable port-channels for baremetal interfaces

    When the Nexus driver creates port-channels for baremetal events,
    an additional capability was provided to allow the user to custom
    configure port-channels that are created.  This is done by way
    of the config variable 'intfcfg.portchannel'  beneath each switch's
    section header [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<switch-ip-address>].
    Nexus CLI commands are defined in this variable unique for each
    switch and sent while creating the port-channel. For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1706965

    Nexus: New vpc id allocation database table

    To implement the vpc id pool for automated port-channel creation with
    baremetal deployments, a new database table was created so a
    database migration is needed to incorporate the new vpcid table.
    The new mysql table name is 'cisco_ml2_nexus_vpc_alloc'. For more details,
    refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1707286 and
