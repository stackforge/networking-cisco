    Nexus: Improved port-channel support with baremetal events

    In previous releases of baremetal support by the Nexus plugin,
    port-channel handling was somewhat limited.  Now when there
    are multiple ethernet interfaces in the baremetal event, the
    Nexus plugin will check to see if they are pre-configured
    for port-channels.  If not, it will create a new port-channel
    and apply a channel-group to the ethernet interfaces. In either
    case, trunk vlans will be applied to the port-channel. For
    details, refer to

    Nexus: User customizable port-channels for baremetal interfaces

    When Nexus plugin creates port-channels for baremetal events,
    an additional capability was provided to allow the user to custom
    configure port-channels that are created.  This is done by way
    of the config variable 'intfcfg.portchannel'  beneath each switch's
    section header [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<switch-ip-address>].
    Nexus CLI commands are defined in this variable unique for each
    switch and sent while creating the port-channel. For details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1706965
