    Nexus: Set default for Configuration Replay to enabled

    Configuration replay is now enabled by default by setting the variable
    'switch_heartbeat_time' to 30 seconds.  If the user does not want this
    feature enabled, the user can set this variable to 0 in the
    'ml2_conf_cisco.ini' file beneath the section header [ml2_cisco].
    When enabled, the nexus plugin checks each nexus switch for
    connectivity and will restore its configuration if a switch recovers
    from failure.
