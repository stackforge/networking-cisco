upgrade:
  - Configuration replay is now enabled by default by setting the variable
    switch_heartbeat_time to 30 seconds.  If the user does not want this
    feature enabled, the user can set this variable to 0 in the
    ml2_conf_cisco.ini file.  This timer causes the nexus plugin to
    check each nexus switch for connectivity.  If the plugin loses
    connectivity with the switch, it will reconfigure it once the switch
    comes back to life.  For further details on this feature, refer to
    ML2 Nexus documentation.
