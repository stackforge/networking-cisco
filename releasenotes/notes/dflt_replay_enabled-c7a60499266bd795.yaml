    Nexus: Set default for Configuration Replay to enabled

    Configuration replay is now enabled by default by setting the variable
    'switch_heartbeat_time' to 30 seconds (defined under the [ml2_cisco]
    section header).  If the user does not want this feature enabled, set
    this variable to 0. When enabled, the nexus plugin checks each switch
    for connectivity and will restore the configuration known to the plugin
    if a switch recovers from failure.
