    Nexus: Set default for Configuration Replay to enabled

    Configuration replay is now enabled by default by setting the variable
    'switch_heartbeat_time' to 30 seconds (defined under the [ml2_cisco]
    section header).  If the administrator does not want this feature enabled,
    set this variable to 0. When enabled, the nexus driver checks each switch
    for connectivity and will restore the configuration known to the driver
    if a switch recovers from failure.  For details, refer to
