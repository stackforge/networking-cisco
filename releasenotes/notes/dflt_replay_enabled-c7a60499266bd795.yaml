upgrade:
  - Configuration replay is now enabled by default by setting the variable
    switch_heartbeat_time to 30 seconds.  If the user does not want this
    feature enabled, the user can set this variable to 0 in the
    ml2_conf_cisco.ini file.  This timer causes the nexus plugin to
    check each nexus switch for connectivity and will restore its
    configuration when a switch recovers from connectivity failure.
    For further details on this feature, refer to ML2 Nexus plugin
    documentation.
