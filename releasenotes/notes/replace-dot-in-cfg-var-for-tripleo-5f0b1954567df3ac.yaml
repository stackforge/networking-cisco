    Nexus: Remove '.' from configuration variable names

    When testing new configuration variables with puppet and tripleo,
    the use of dot '.' in configuration variable name fails.
    There is only one such variable which is `intfcfg.portchannel`. It
    is replaced with `intfcfg_portchannel`.
