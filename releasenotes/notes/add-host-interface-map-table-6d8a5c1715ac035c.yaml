    Nexus: Add host to switch/interface mapping table.

    This table was introduced so host to switch/interface mapping can be
    learned for baremetal events and shared with multiple controllers.
    When DNS is enabled, the host name for baremetal events will be the
    dns name. When not enabled, the host name defaults to 'reserved_port'.
    For cleanliness, all statically configured host to interface mappings
    are included to this table. For more details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1691194
