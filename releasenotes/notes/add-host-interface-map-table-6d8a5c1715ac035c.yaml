    Nexus: Add host to switch/interface mapping database table.

    A new database table for host to interface mapping is added
    for baremetal deployments.  The administrator must perform a
    database migration to incorporate this upgrade.  The new mysql
    table name is 'cisco_ml2_nexus_host_interface_mapping'.
