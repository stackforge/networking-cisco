    Nexus: Add host to switch/interface mapping table.

    Add host to switch/interface mapping table to allow this data to be
    learned for baremetal events and shared with multiple controller.
    When DNS is enabled, the host name for baremetal events is the
    dns name. When not enabled, the host name defaults to 'reserved_port'.
    For cleanliness, all statically configured host to interface mappings
    are included to this table. For more details, refer to
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-cisco/+bug/1691194
