UCSM Mechanism Driver Administration Guide
===========================================
The configuration parameters for the ML2 UCSM Mechanism Diver can be
specified along with the Neutron configuration parameters. Another approach
could be to use TripleO config for Openstack over Openstack installations.

For a description of what activites are performed by the Nexus Driver
for VLAN and VXLAN configuration, refer to
:doc:`UCSM MD Overview and Architecture documentation </reference/ml2-ucsm>`.
